# LPC812 XSON16 breakout
Breakout board for the LPC812 in XSON16 package. This is more or less a test bed to do everything as small as possible. So 0201 components, tiny crystal, everything tiny!
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* LPC812M101JTB16
* All passives are 0201
