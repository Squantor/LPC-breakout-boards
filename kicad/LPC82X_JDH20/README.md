# LPC824 TSSOP20 breakout
This is a LPC824 breakout for the TSSOP20 package, all GPIO's are brought out and contains SWD programming header, crystal footprint and a decoupling network (capacitors and ferrite beads) for the analog supplies.

This breakout can be used in prototyping PCB and breadboards as the breakout headers have a 2.54mm pitch.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry (Done)
* PCB layout (Done)
* Review with one night in between (In progress)
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/3IGWIivt)
* Assemble (leadfree with paste)
* Test (blinky!)
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
Due to the general shortage of passive components, where mentioned, just whatever you can find.
* 0402 100nF 6.3V (generic)
* 0402 Ferrite bead (Murata BLM15PX601SN1D 600Ohm 900mA [Farnell](https://nl.farnell.com/2840091)
* 0603 1uF 6.3V (generic)
