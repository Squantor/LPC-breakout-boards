# LPC824 QFN33 breakout 2 layer version
This is a LPC824 breakout for the QFN33 package, all GPIO's are brought out and contains SWD programming header, reset and bootloader button, crystal footprint and a decoupling network (capacitors and ferrite beads) for the analog supplies.

This breakout can be used in prototyping PCB as the breakout headers match the 2.54mm pitch of such a PCB.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Review after a day
* Produce (OSHpark)
* Assemble (leadfree with paste)
* Test (blinky!)
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
Most parts ordered from farnell.com
