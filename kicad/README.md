# KiCad LPC breakout boards
We have here a bunch of LPC series microcontroller breakouts. Each of the kicad project dirs contains its own README.
All of the breakouts are using the [squantorPcbLibrary](https://github.com/Squantor/squantorPcbLibrary.git) where needed. Gerbers, and other plots are located per project but only when they have been sent off to production.
